# efficient vulkan - [EWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewok) (WIP)
### This project wraps CMake and c++20 modules around vulkan.hpp + adds some optional convenience helper functions on top of it
The goal here is not to make another vulkan framework, but instead to provide convenience functions that can be opted in and out at any given time.
